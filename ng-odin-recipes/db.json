        "It's a bright, sunny morning - and you have a gnawing hunger. But alas! You have not the time to inspire the chef in you to wake up and become the best chef like no one ever was. Gotta make them all? But your Hunger says it's not got the time for you to role play Mash Ketchup for 20-odd years on television all the time saving Pikachow from Steam Rocket. What can you make in ten minutes and on which you wouldn't Choke(m)on?",
        "The answer is right here on this page - toast some crispy, buttery bread optionally with fragrant oregano and whip up some sunny side up eggs with runny yolk, rich and thick like creamy soup which you'd scoop up with the crackling bread, to end up on your tongue which'd take you on a ride ending with you craving and wanting for more!"

      "ingredients": [
        "Eggs",
        "Brown bread",
        "Oregano (or)",
        "Chilli flakes / powder",
        "Pepper powder",
        "Salt",
        "(Salted) Butter"
      ],
      "steps": [
        "Smear butter on bread slices as per your taste and optionally sprinkle oregano or a combination of pepper and salt, else if you are using salted butter, you might not really want the extra seasoning.",
        "Place the bread on a pan on medium heat and toast it until the bread is crisp to a degree of your liking.",
        "While the bread is being toasted, you can set up a (circular) pan for the eggs.",
        "Coat the pan with butter and optionally sprinkle salt or oregano to season the underside of the egg(s) as well.",
        "Light up the pan and once the butter bubbles, you can crack open the egg(s) and make sure to take care not to break the yolk for a perfect sunny side up egg.",
        "Sprinkle oregano or a combination of chilli powder/flakes, salt and pepper, the ratios varying to your liking.",
        "Once you feel the egg is cooked, you can jiggle the egg on to the toasted bread (it becomes easy because of the butter coating) or place it on the side.",
        "However if you want a runny yolk, you may want to not let the egg cook for much longer.",
        "Voil√†, you have a delicious meal ready!"

        "Another day, another dawn, yet again you've got to whip up some quick breakfast to satisfy the pangs of Hunger, which grows nastier teeth by the day to chew on the insides of your Stomach. Your Stomach then cries out in pain sending the unhappiest tears it can think of through the nerves over to your Brain, which is still hungover and wants your Stomach to just shut up for once so that it can have peace in the overworked life that it has. ;(",
        "Then, somehow, you've landed on this here page where you see noods and eggs, and your Mouth just drools all over your pillow since your brain hasn't helped you get up being the lazy bum that it is. But you see the golden glow of the Maggi and the bright, yellow circle of delight that a sunny-side up egg seasoned in the water of the noodles. And you find yourself teleported into your kitchen, with your Brain all revved up to amaze your Stomach, screaming, 'LET'S GO PEOPLE' to all the motor skills it can muster from your exercise-deprived, uncoordinated mess of a body."

        "Add the noodle seasoning, the noodles and light/switch on the stove and let the noodles cook until they become soft and to the point where they're almost cooked.",
        "Crack open the egg carefully to get a sunny side up egg on top of the noodles.",
        "You can sprinkle some salt over the egg, and some oregano if you've some around.",

        "A lazy afternoon, and your lunch has gone through your system and you want something to accompany your (accented British) evening tea. Argh, you don't want to cook yet again. You'll have to spend at least a half an hour later to cook dinner since you've not any leftovers from the lunch you greedily gobbled up. And you've so. Much. Work. To. Do. Sigh. You spy with your eye sitting in your refridgerator a couple of eggs sitting invitingly, generating ears for your Stomach as they call out to it, clamoring for its attention and then yours, because when have you not listened to it? They whisper, soft and low, \"Eat usss\", and you can swear you've heard a snake somewhere close by, and you end up wondering if there's a Chamber of Secrets in your house.",
        "One of the most simplest things to eat, lusciously textured, pleasant on the tongue, irresistible pieces of white and gold, ready in no less than ten minutes and made infinitely more attractive with the many permutations of combinations of seasonings you can use. Control your excitement, or you may end up crushing or dropping the eggs you're about to reach out and grab!"
