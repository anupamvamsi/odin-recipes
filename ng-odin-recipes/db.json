        "Another day, another dawn, yet again you've got to whip up some quick breakfast to satisfy the pangs of Hunger, which grows nastier teeth by the day to chew on the insides of your Stomach. Your Stomach then cries out in pain sending the unhappiest tears it can think of through the nerves over to your Brain, which is still hungover and wants your Stomach to just shut up for once so that it can have peace in the overworked life that it has. ;(",
        "Then, somehow, you've landed on this here page where you see noods and eggs, and your Mouth just drools all over your pillow since your brain hasn't helped you get up being the lazy bum that it is. But you see the golden glow of the Maggi and the bright, yellow circle of delight that a sunny-side up egg seasoned in the water of the noodles. And you find yourself teleported into your kitchen, with your Brain all revved up to amaze your Stomach, screaming, 'LET'S GO PEOPLE' to all the motor skills it can muster from your exercise-deprived, uncoordinated mess of a body."

      "ingredients": [
        "Maggi (or any ready-to-make noodles with its own seasoning packet)",
        "Egg(s)",
        "Salt",
        "Oregano (optional)"
      ],
      "steps": [
        "Add water to a bowl and add the indicated amount of water by the noodle packet's instructions.",
        "Add about half a cup extra water, and sprinkle some salt to compensate the extra water, since the dilution takes away some flavor from the noodles.",
        "Add the noodle seasoning, the noodles and light/switch on the stove and let the noodles cook until they become soft and to the point where they're almost cooked.",
        "Crack open the egg carefully to get a sunny side up egg on top of the noodles.",
        "You can sprinkle some salt over the egg, and some oregano if you've some around.",
        "Ensure that the egg is covered by the noodle water so that it gets seasoned with it.",
        "Cover the noodles with a lid so that the steam cooks the egg.",
        "After a while you should have a well-noodle-seasoned delicious egg and noodles ready to gorge yourself on!"
