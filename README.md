## [Project 1 (TheOdinProject)](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes)

The project is aimed to gain an understanding of the basic elements in HTML.

My implementation of the project covers the requirement of the understanding and usage of the HTML elements along with using CSS, though it is not currently specified as a requirement for completing the project.

The end result of the project is hosted [here](https://anupamvamsi.github.io/odin-recipes/), using [github-pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).
