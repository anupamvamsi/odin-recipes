    <h2 class="headings">Description</h2>
    <p>A lazy afternoon, and your lunch has gone through your system and you want something to accompany your
      <em>(accented British)</em> evening tea. Argh, you don't want to cook yet <em>again.</em> You'll have to spend at
      least a half an hour later to cook dinner since you've not any leftovers from the lunch you greedily gobbled up.
      <em>And</em> you've <em>so. Much. Work. To. Do.</em> Sigh. You spy with your eye sitting in your refridgerator a
      couple of eggs sitting invitingly, generating ears for your Stomach as they call out to it, clamoring for its
      attention and then yours, because when have you not listened to it?
      They whisper, soft and low, <em>"Eat usss"</em>, and you can swear you've heard a snake somewhere close by, and
      you end up wondering if there's a Chamber of Secrets in your house.
    </p>

    <p>One of the most simplest things to eat, lusciously textured, pleasant on the tongue, irresistible pieces of white
      and gold, ready in no less than ten minutes and made infinitely more attractive with the many permutations of
      combinations of seasonings you can use. Control your excitement or you may end up crushing or dropping the eggs
      you're about to reach out and grab.</p>

    <h2 class="headings">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ulist-content">
      <li>Egg(s)</li>
      <li>Chaat (or)</li>
      <li>Chilli/Peri Peri powder</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Pepper powder</li>
      <li>Anything else you have/can think of as a seasoning, for e.g., oregano</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="headings">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="olist-content">
      <li>Boil an egg in water or if you have a boiler machine to boil your eggs.</li>
      <li>Once you boil your egg enough to your liking (soft/hard), peel your egg.</li>
      <li>Cut it into halves and quarters if you like.</li>
      <li>Go wild with the seasonings, and you've a light snack or a hunger savior ready depending on the number of
        eggs!</li>
    </ol>
